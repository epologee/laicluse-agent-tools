# bonsai changelog

The post-update broadcast shows the topmost section once per machine whenever
the installed `version` in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` changes. Keep entries
short; categories are Breaking, Added, Changed, Fixed.

## [v2.0.0]

### Added

- **Worktree CLI**: `bonsai create`, `bonsai setup`, and `bonsai teardown`
  manage the full worktree lifecycle git-natively, with `--json` facts output.
- **Safety gate on teardown**: a clean-but-non-integrated worktree is kept by
  default; removal needs integration or an explicit `--force`. Warns on orphaned
  unpushed commits and on a diverged default branch.
- **Skills**: `bonsai` (create + setup), `setup`, and `prune`, agent-neutral and
  resolving the CLI cross-agent.

### Breaking

- Moved from `bonsai@leclause` and dropped the clipboard / start-command
  mechanism and the macOS-only requirement. Bonsai now emits facts and launches
  nothing. Install `bonsai@laicluse-agent-tools`.
