# Migration to l'Aicluse Agent Tools

Status: public, first migration slice active.

## Decision

The legacy public marketplace `epologee/leclause-skills` will not be renamed in
place. This repository becomes the new public canonical home under the
`laicluse-agent-tools` marketplace alias.

During the transition:

- `leclause-skills` remains the existing public source for users.
- `laicluse-agent-tools` is the new public home for multi-agent-compatible
  successors.
- `how-plugins-work` and git-discipline may temporarily exist in multiple
  places. That is migration duplication, not a DRY problem.
- The new canonical plugin name for git-discipline is
  `git-discipline@laicluse-agent-tools`; the legacy public name
  `gitgit@leclause` stays in place until the old marketplace can carry a
  plugin-specific migration stub.
- Migration status belongs here and in package-specific changelogs or stubs,
  not in `how-plugins-work`. That skill documents plugin mechanics only:
  naming, aliases, cache behavior, and adapter sync.

## For Existing Users

Install the new marketplace alongside the old one:

```bash
claude plugins marketplace add epologee/laicluse-agent-tools
```

Marketplace aliases are installation identities; `@leclause` does not become
`@laicluse-agent-tools` automatically.

When a plugin moves, the old marketplace keeps at least one migration stub that
explains which legacy install can be removed and which new install replaces it.
Only then may the real legacy plugin disappear.

## For Agents

Work plugin by plugin. Keep Claude metadata as the source and generate Codex
adapters with `bin/plugin-adapters`. Keep runtime state under
`${LAICLUSE_AGENT_HOME:-$HOME/.laicluse-agent}`.
