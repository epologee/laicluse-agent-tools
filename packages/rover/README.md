# rover

Dispatch a rover at a task. You stay back, the rover works in the field. The
distance means it decides locally rather than round-tripping every question, so
the plugin carries a `decide` framework, a contrarian `pride` check, a
subtraction-biased `trim` pass, and an evidence-discipline `verify` pass. The
rover only reports done when the mission is solid.

This is the decision framework half of the old `autonomous` plugin. The
keep-it-running half (cron heartbeat, wake/restore) now lives in the
`autonomous` plugin, and the rover asks it one question at startup through
`autonomous:keepalive`: am I in a persistent process, or an interactive session
that needs a heartbeat to stay alive? The caller no longer has to know or say.

## Dependencies

- **`autonomous@laicluse-agent-tools`** (same marketplace): the keep-alive
  layer. The rover invokes `autonomous:keepalive` at dispatch.
- **`gurus@laicluse-agent-tools`** (same marketplace): the rover invokes
  `gurus:gurus` once per mission at INSPECT for opinionated panel review; the
  orchestrator routes to `gurus:software`, `gurus:council`, `gurus:writers`,
  or any future panel.

Install together:

```bash
claude plugins install rover@laicluse-agent-tools autonomous@laicluse-agent-tools gurus@laicluse-agent-tools
codex plugin add rover@laicluse-agent-tools
codex plugin add autonomous@laicluse-agent-tools
codex plugin add gurus@laicluse-agent-tools
```

**Host contract for persistent runs.** The keep-alive probe reads the process's
scheduling hooks to pick a heartbeat. To configure a persistent host:

- **Self-paced with a heartbeat** (recommended for a supervised run like a
  conveyor line that watches for stalls): withhold `CronCreate`, `CronDelete`,
  and `CronList` (add them to the disallowed-tools list), and leave the
  self-pacing wake-up hook (`ScheduleWakeup` in `claude --bg`) reachable. The
  probe schedules a self-check heartbeat that keeps the run from dying silently
  on the host's stall timer.
- **Pure batch, no heartbeat** (only when nothing supervises the run for
  stalls): withhold every scheduling hook, the cron tools and the wake-up hook
  alike. The probe schedules nothing and the run drives straight to completion.
- **Do not leave the cron tools reachable** on a persistent host: the probe then
  reads the run as interactive and schedules an unused cron.

The mode the probe actually picked is visible after setup in the loop file's
`cron_job_id`: `none (self-check heartbeat)` confirms the wake-up path,
`none (persistent process)` means it fell through to batch (the wake-up hook was
not reachable). See `autonomous`'s `keepalive` skill for the full contract.

No other hard dependencies. Optional integrations (notifier, reviewbot,
commit-splitter) are user-named at invocation and only used when installed.

## User-invocable skills

### `/rover:rover [loop-file-path | free-form text]`

Entry point. Accepts a loop file path to resume (delegates to `autonomous:wake`)
or free-form mission text (a description, a pasted issue body, a GitHub URL).
Writes `.autonomous/<NAME>.md` (the loop file), asks the autonomy layer whether a
heartbeat is needed, and runs the first SURVEY iteration. The rover does not
fetch remote content on its own; paste an issue body or PR diff into the
invocation if it is part of the mission.

### `/rover:stop [loop-file-path]`

Cleanly stop a running mission. Cuts the cron (when one was scheduled), writes a
final log entry, and transmits a mission-report communiqué.

### `/rover:pride [git-range | uncommitted]`

Spawns a contrarian agent that reviews a rover artefact for what the user would
notice but the rover missed. Hard gate inside the rover on every artefact
(code, docs, prose, research briefs, media, communiqués), not just pushes. Also
invocable directly.

### `/rover:trim [git-range | uncommitted]`

The subtraction pass: what got added that does not earn its weight? Hard gate in
INSPECT, the inverse of pride.

### `/rover:verify [--propose <loop-file> | <loop-file> | free text]`

Evidence discipline. With `--propose`, writes Done criteria at the end of
SURVEY. Default mode ticks each criterion with evidence at the end of INSPECT.

### `/rover:decide [free text]`

Choice framework for a fork in the field, or for any moment an operator is stuck
between options.

### `/rover:prepare [target repo + mission brief]`

Lay a rover loop file in another repo's `.autonomous/` now, so the operator can
pick it up later from inside that repo.

### `/rover:rover-help`

The rover briefing.

## Phase machine

```
SURVEY -> DRIVE -> INSPECT -> STOW -> STANDBY
```

The loop is autonomous. It does not ask questions mid-phase. When it hits a
choice it invokes `decide`. Before any artefact leaves the rover (push, PR,
handoff communiqué, research brief, generated doc, media, or any other
deliverable) it invokes `pride`. Pushes themselves are never autonomous: the
user must say "push" or equivalent.

## Loop file

Lives in `.autonomous/<NAME>.md` at the git root. Holds context, plan, Done
criteria, decision audit trail, and a timestamped log. Tail it to watch
progress. The format is unchanged from the old `autonomous` plugin, so existing
loop files still wake.
