# how-plugins-work changelog

The post-update broadcast (see `bin/check-broadcast`) shows the topmost
section once per machine whenever the installed `version` in
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` changes. Entry headers record the version at
which the entry was written; a pre-commit hook auto-bumps `plugin.json` on
every commit, so the header may lag the shipped version. Header numbers are
informational, the broadcast is positional. Use the `--force` flag on the
helper to re-read at any time.

Categories:

- **Breaking**: user must adapt
- **Added**: new commands, new optional behavior
- **Changed**: non-breaking adjustments worth knowing about
- **Fixed**: silent unless the bug was user-visible

Patch-level fixes that change nothing the user can observe are intentionally
omitted; the broadcast budget is for things the user benefits from knowing.
The helper writes the sentinel only when stdout is non-empty, so a CHANGELOG
without a `## [vX.Y.Z]` section stays silent on every update.

## [v2.0.13]

### Changed

- **Generated Codex payloads now call out plugin `agents/`.** When a source
  package ships plugin-level subagent definitions and the Codex adapter points
  at `.agents/plugins/generated/<plugin>`, the generated root must carry
  `agents/` alongside `skills/` and `bin/`.
- **The Claude subagent verification note no longer claims `claude agents`
  lists plugin-shipped agents.** Current Claude Code uses that command for
  background agent sessions; use `claude plugins validate` for schema and a
  live `claude -p --plugin-dir ...` Task-spawn for runtime proof.

## [v2.0.5]

### Changed

- **First public l'Aicluse release.** `how-plugins-work` now ships from
  `how-plugins-work@laicluse-agent-tools` with major version 2.

## [v1.0.4]

### Added

- **Agent-specific skill source convention.** `SKILL.md` is now reserved for
  truly agent-agnostic skill sources; paired `SKILL.claude.md` and
  `SKILL.codex.md` sources are generated into runtime `SKILL.md` targets when
  behavior needs to differ per agent.

## [v1.0.3]

### Changed

- **Project status moved out of the mechanics reference.** `how-plugins-work`
  now stays focused on plugin naming, marketplace aliases, adapter sync, caches,
  and local install mechanics; repo transition state belongs in repo-level docs.

## [v1.0.1]

### Changed

- **Multi-agent local marketplace baseline.** The skill now covers both Claude
  Code and Codex local marketplace installs, and stores broadcast state under
  `${LAICLUSE_HOME:-~/.laicluse}`.

## [v1.0.31]

### Added

- **Cross-agent sync vocabulary.** The skill now explains how to keep shared `SKILL.md` sources, Claude manifests, Codex manifests, marketplace indexes, and runtime caches in separate source/adapter/cache roles.

## [v1.0.27]

### Changed

- **Haiku no longer suggested as a subagent target.** Token-savings example lists Sonnet only (Sonnet has its own usage allocation; Haiku does not); the factual reference about supported `model` values still includes `haiku`.
